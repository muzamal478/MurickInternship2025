# Week 1 - Python Programming Questions

## Overview
This folder contains solutions to the 10 Python programming questions assigned for Week 1 of the AI & ML Internship at Murick Technologies. Each solution is implemented in Python, thoroughly commented, and tested for accuracy and efficiency. The code demonstrates core programming concepts like functions, error handling, string manipulation, and mathematical computations.

## Files
- `q1_smart_calculator.py`: A calculator supporting basic arithmetic, power, and modulus operations with error handling.
- `q2_circle_properties.py`: Calculates the area and circumference of a circle with input validation.
- `q3_enhanced_number_classifier.py`: Analyzes a number for properties like sign, parity, perfect square, and power of 2.
- `q4_word_analysis_tool.py`: Analyzes a sentence for character count, word count, vowels, consonants, and letter frequency.
- `q5_number_pattern_generator.py`: Generates a customizable number pattern with replacement words for multiples.
- `q6_advanced_string_checker.py`: Checks if a string is a palindrome, contains only alphabetic characters, and has balanced parentheses.
- `q7_interactive_guessing_game.py`: A number guessing game with hints, scoring, and difficulty levels.
- `q8_mathematical_sequence_generator.py`: Generates Fibonacci, prime, or perfect square sequences based on user input.
- `q9_text_pattern_analyzer.py`: Checks for anagrams and finds the longest common subsequence between two strings.
- `q10_multi_unit_converter.py`: Converts between temperature and length units with a menu-driven interface.

## Installation
