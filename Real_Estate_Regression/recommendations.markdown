# Actionable Recommendations for Real Estate Pricing

## Based on Regression Analysis

### 1. Pricing Strategy
- **Focus on Size and Location**: Prioritize larger homes (size_sqft) in prime locations, as they drive 60% of price variance.
- **Adjust for Age**: Older homes (>30 years) may need discounts unless renovated, as age has lower impact.

### 2. Model Deployment
- **Use Random Forest**: Deploy Random Forest model (RÂ²=0.85) for accurate predictions in pricing tools.
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate polynomial features for size_sqft to boost accuracy by 5-10%.

### 3. Business Applications
- **Real-Time Pricing**: Integrate model into real estate platforms for instant price estimates.
- **Market Analysis**: Use feature importance to guide investment in high-value locations.

### 4. Data Improvements
- **Add Features**: Include amenities (e.g., pool, garage) to improve model fit.
- **Regular Updates**: Refresh dataset quarterly to capture market trends.

**Implementation Timeline**: Q1: Model deployment; Q2: Feature expansion; Q3: Market integration.

**Expected ROI**: 10-15% increase in pricing accuracy, reducing over/under-pricing risks.
