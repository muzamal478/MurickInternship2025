# Actionable Recommendations for Waste Reduction

## Based on EDA Insights

### 1. Seasonal Inventory Adjustments
- **Summer (High Waste Season)**: Reduce vegetable stock by 20-25% due to temperature spikes; prioritize dairy monitoring (humidity r=0.45).
- **Winter (Low Waste)**: Increase grains/barley inventory; use excess capacity for events.

### 2. Staff Optimization
- **Expert Staff Priority**: Assign expert staff (15% waste reduction) to high-volume days/spikes (>3000 meals).
- **Training Programs**: Invest in intermediate-to-expert upskilling; target beginner waste reduction.

### 3. Event Management
- **Pre-Event Planning**: For special events (30% meal increase, 10% waste rise), boost staffing by 20% and adjust portions.
- **Post-Event Review**: Analyze waste post-events for pattern refinement.

### 4. Weather-Based Strategies
- **Humidity Alerts**: When humidity >70%, shorten dairy storage; use dehumidifiers in kitchens.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Forecast-based prep adjustments for vegetables/meat.

### 5. Overall Metrics
- **Target Reduction**: Implement changes for 15-20% overall waste cut.
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Use interactive Plotly viz for ongoing tracking.

**Implementation Timeline**: Q1: Staff training; Q2: Inventory system; Q3: Weather integration.

**Expected ROI**: 10-15% cost savings on food procurement.
